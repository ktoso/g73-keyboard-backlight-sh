Asus G73 Keyboard Backlight GNU/Linux Scripts
=============================================
<img src="https://github.com/ktoso/g73-keyboard-backlight-sh/raw/master/g73_keyboard.jpg"/>

To enable the `Fn + F3` and `Fn + F4` shortcuts to work under linux and really
manipulate the backlight brighntess on your **Asus G73** series notebook, follow theese simple steps:

1. Clone this repository to your home directory (or wherever you want to, I'll do this example for ~/ for simplicity)

        cd
        git clone git://github.com/ktoso/g73-keyboard-backlight-sh.git g73

2. Make sure all scripts are marked executable:

        cd g73
        chmod +x *.sh

3. Take a look at these scripts to make sure you trust them, why? Because they'll need root access, without asking for the password  . Now we'll add these scripts to allow `sudo`to run them without asking for any password:

        su -c 'visudo' # or 'sudo visudo' if you're a sudoer (on ubuntu etc)

 There just add the following lines at the end of this file (or similar, with the script names etc). Of course, replace `ktoso` and `/home/ktoso/` with your *username* and *your home directory*.

        ## allow running keyboard backlight scripts
        ktoso ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/home/ktoso/g73/*

4. Now all that's left is to setup the key bindings for the scripts. If you're on KDE4, just go to *System Settings -> Shortcuts and Gestures -> Custom Shortcuts* and *edit -> import...* the file **~/g73/g73_keyboard.khotkeys** which contains ready keybindings for these scripts. Now you may use `Fn + F3` to make the keyboard backlight shine **less**, and the `Fn + F4` combination to make it shine **more**.

   If you're on a GNOME or other windowing system, please follow the usual steps for them to add some own keybinding. What you want to bind is simply calling the ~/g73/g73\_light\_up.sh and ~/g73/g73\_light\_down.sh scrips - easy :-)
